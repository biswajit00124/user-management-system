# user-management-system

1. Create Operation:
    Functionality: Allows creating new user accounts.
    Implementation Steps:
    Collect user input for creating a new user (e.g., username, password, email, role).
    Validate user input to ensure it meets the required criteria (e.g., valid email format, password strength).
    Create a new user object with the provided information.
    Save the user object to the database using DAO (Data Access Object) layer.
    Provide feedback to the user indicating whether the operation was successful or if there were any errors.
   
3. Read Operation:
    Functionality: Allows retrieving user information.
    Implementation Steps:
    Retrieve user input (e.g., username) to identify the user whose information needs to be retrieved.
    Query the database to fetch the user information based on the provided input using DAO layer.
    Display the retrieved user information to the user interface.
   
5. Update Operation:
    Functionality: Allows updating existing user information.
    Implementation Steps:
    Retrieve user input to identify the user whose information needs to be updated.
    Query the database to fetch the user object based on the provided input using DAO layer.
    Display the existing user information to the user interface for modification.
    Collect the updated information from the user.
    Update the user object with the new information.
    Save the updated user object to the database using DAO layer.
    Provide feedback to the user indicating whether the operation was successful or if there were any errors.
   
7. Delete Operation:
    Functionality: Allows deleting existing user accounts.
    Implementation Steps:
    Retrieve user input (e.g., username) to identify the user account to be deleted.
    Query the database to fetch the user object based on the provided input using DAO layer.
    Display the user information to confirm deletion.
    Prompt the user for confirmation.
    If confirmed, delete the user object from the database using DAO layer.
    Provide feedback to the user indicating whether the operation was successful or if there were any errors.
   
Technologies/Frameworks:
    Backend: Java.
    Database: MySQL.
    Development Tools: IDEs like  Eclipse.
    Code Organization:
        User Model: Java class representing user data.
        DAO Layer: Classes/interfaces responsible for database interactions (e.g., UserRepository using Spring Data JPA).
        Service Layer: Classes containing business logic for CRUD operations.
        Controller Layer: Classes handling HTTP requests and responses.
        User Interface: Web-based UI or command-line interface for user interaction.
        By implementing these CRUD operations, you can create a basic User Management System in Java that allows users to be created, read, updated, and deleted from the system. This forms 
        the foundation upon which additional features and functionalities can be built.
